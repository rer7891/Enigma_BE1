**Functionality:** Meets Expectations <br>
  I believe the command line interface is working correctly and the runner file produces the correct hashes.<br><br>
**Object Oriented Programming** Meets Expectations<br>
I have five classes and only 2 methods are longer than seven lines. No class is over 100 lines. Variable are well named.<br><br>
**Test Driven Development** Meets Expectations <br>
Every method is tested and simple cov is running at 100%. I developed tests and then wrote methods. At times I had to rewrite tests as methods evolved but testing was always done in tandom. <br><br>
**Version Control** Meets Expectations<br>
I have 16 pull requests and 56 commits. I tried to keep commits to single chunks of functionality.
